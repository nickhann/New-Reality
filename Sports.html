			Midway through the third quarter of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals back in May, the defending champion Boston Celtics had a 20-point lead over the New York Knicks, having won eight of the last nine head-to-head meetings. But then came a miraculous Knicks comeback, which was followed by another two nights later in Game 2. Jayson Tatum tore his Achilles in Game 4 and the Knicks won the series in six. Boston broke up its championship roster over the summer and here we are.

			Suddenly, the Knicks are one of the favorites and the Celtics are on a lower tier in the Eastern Conference. Things went according to (the new) script on Friday, when New York cruised to a 105-95 victory on in the second game of the season for both teams.

		It’s kind of amazing how this rivalry turned on a dime.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width:950px;"><p>Prior to the game, both teams’ coaches spoke to the importance of getting more shots than your opponent, primarily with the pursuit of offensive rebounds.<br>
		“[Teams] understand that it’s about the possession game,” said Knicks coach Mike Brown. “Because everybody is so talented offensively. You just got to try to find ways to generate more possessions.”<br><br>
		“How can we find different ways to win the shot margin?” asked Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla. “Get more possessions, get more shots.”<br><br>
		And with both teams weathering below-average shooting nights, the Knicks were the team dominating the glass, despite the absence of Mitchell Robinson, their best offensive rebounder.<br><br>
		New York grabbed 21 offensive rebounds, the most for any team in a game this season. In total, the Knicks grabbed 60.4% of available rebounds, what would have been their fourth-best mark in 100 total games (regular season + playoffs) last season. In a 10-point game, second chance points were 21-7 in favor of the Knicks, who have now had eight more shooting opportunities than their opponent in each of their first two games.<br><br>

The Celtics still have some talent on their roster, but almost all of that talent is on the perimeter, and interior play may continue to be an issue throughout the season. There was also a huge discrepancy (22-10) at the free throw line on Friday.<br><br></p>

		<td style="width:950px;"><p>Later in the fourth, Hart airballed a wide-open corner 3-pointer and then appeared to reinjure his surgically-repaired right hand when he tried to block a shot on the ensuing transition sequence.
		Opponents will give him open shots all season long, and there will be big possessions when the ball is in his hands with the shot clock winding down
		There will also be big possessions when he gives the Knicks multiple chances to score. If it comes down to the possession game, Hart is an asset.With the 7-foot Robinson out, the Knicks’ best offensive rebounder is 6-foot-sd5 Josh Hart, who made his season debut on Friday.<br><br>
		While New York made a change to its starting lineup, it wasn’t Hart who replaced Ariel Hukporti and moved Karl-Anthony Towns to center. It was Miles McBride, with Hart coming off the bench in a regular-season game for the first time since January 2024.<br><br>
		With the assumption that Robinson (who’s missed both games) will be a regular starter when healthy, Hart has been a fashionable pick to win the Kia NBA Sixth Man of the Year award, even though that’s typically reserved for scorers, like new teammate Jordan Clarkson. Hart has averaged only 11.3 points per game during his 2 1/2 seasons with the Knicks.<br><br>
		Hart scored just two points on 1-for-8 shooting off the bench on Friday, and the Knicks were outscored by two points in his 19 minutes. But he grabbed 14 rebounds, with six of them coming on the offensive glass. When the Knicks weren’t shooting well, Hart kept possessions alive with his typical, relentless pursuit of the ball.<br><br>
		“A monster, monster, monster,” Brown said. “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen this before, 14 rebounds in 19 minutes. Just a phenomenal, phenomenal game, doing the dirty stuff.”<br><br>
		At the end of the first half, he grabbed an offensive board and found OG Anunoby for a wide-open 3-pointer to cap off the Knicks’ 42-14 second quarter.<br><br>
		Midway through the fourth, when the Knicks’ 24-point lead had been cut to 10, Hart checked in after a timeout. And on the very next possession, he grabbed two offensive boards, with the second leading to a Brunson layup that put the Knicks back up 12.<br></p>
